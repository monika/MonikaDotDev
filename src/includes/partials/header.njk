    <p><strong>I have fifteen years of experience bringing design solutions into code as a front-end developer for a diverse set of clients.</strong></p>

    <p>Clients are guided towards tech solutions that fit their project goals, team workflow, budget, and existing stack. My design experience allows me to bridge the space between design and development while maintaining a focus on accessibility, responsiveness, and maintainability.</p>
    
    <p>I'm available for new projects and full-time employment.</p>
