## An Aptitude Testing Suite

### With the expense of college tuition increasing every year, aptitude testing can help students and parents save thousands of dollars a year

Before YouScience, aptitude testing was out of many student's reach. It requires spending hundreds of dollars, going to a testing facility, spending 4+ hours taking the test, and reviewing the results with a career councilor face-to-face. YouScience's goal is to make the entire process more approachable, less expensive, and less time-consuming while providing in-depth results that help students make better choices that lean into their strengths for their career options.

For Sparkart Group, Inc., I updated the look and feel of the aptitude tests, modernized the user's interactions with the different test types, and developed high fidelity prototypes for YouScience's in-house developers to build in time for test standardization.

#### Responsibilities

- Auditing user flow through testing suite
- Modernizing aptitude tests visual design and interactions
- Animating test prototypes for in-house developers
- Interfacing with YouScience's developers
