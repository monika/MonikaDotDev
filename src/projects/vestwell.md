### The Story

_A digitial retirement platform for financial advisors, employers, and employees, that makes it easier to understand and save for retirement._

Vestwell is redefining what it means to invest in your retirement. With that goal, they needed a site that educated users on what their platform offers, whether that user is a broker who provides investment advice to her clients, an employer that provides retirement services to their employees, or an employee interested in their own retirement plan.

With a recent rebranding in mid 2018, I was tasked with rebuilding and reorganizing their informational site. I took full advantage of Vestwell's new illustrative branding style to use SVGs for crisp, clean icons regardless of screen pixel density, and since no content needed to be stored, I built their new site using a static site generator.

Despite being a relatively consise site, I built a basic design system to speed up page delivery and used a slightly modified BEM naming-methodology to keep the markup legible for myself and for any other developers.
