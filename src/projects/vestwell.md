## The Story

_A digitial retirement platform for financial advisors, employers, and employees. that makes it easier to understand and save for retirement._

Vestwell is redefining what it means to invest in your retirement. With that goal, they needed a site that educated users on what their platform offers, whether that user is a broker who provides investment advice to her clients, an employer that provides retirement services to their employees, or an employee interested in their own retirement plan.

Originally built using a static site generator, the site has been upgraded with a customized CMS platform to allow for text and image updates from their internal marketing team. Needs and goals can change, and Vestwell's site was adapted to those changes.

Vestwell is on a mission to change the way people manage their retirement funds to maximize the amount of funds people have available to them when they retire with their custom web-based app.

With a recent rebranding in mid 2018, I was tasked with rebuilding and reorganizing their informational site. I took full advantage of Vestwell's new illustrative branding style to use SVGs for crisp, clean icons regardless of screen pixel density, and since no content needed to be stored, I built their new site using a static site generator.

Despite being a relatively consise site, I built a basic design system to speed up page delivery and used a slightly modified BEM naming-methodology to keep the markup legible for myself and for any other developers.
