### The Story

_A digital retirement platform for financial advisors, employers, and employees, that makes it easier to understand and save for retirement._

Vestwell is redefining what it means to invest in your retirement. With that goal, they needed a site that educated users on what their platform offers, whether that user is a broker who provides investment advice to her clients, an employer that provides retirement services to their employees, or an employee interested in his own retirement plan.

With a recent rebranding in mid-2018, I was tasked with rebuilding and reorganizing their informational site. I took full advantage of Vestwell's new illustrative branding style to use SVGs for crisp, clean icons regardless of screen pixel density and file size, and since no content needed to be managed, I built their new site using a static site generator to increase development speed.

Despite being a relatively concise site, I built a basic design system to speed up page deployment, and used a slightly modified BEM naming-methodology to keep the markup legible for myself and for any other developers who might join the project.
