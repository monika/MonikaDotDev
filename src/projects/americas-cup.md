### The Project

_America’s Cup comes home to San Francisco. Every team racing in the 2013 America’s Cup needed a branded team portal._

In 2013, the America’s Cup was headed back to the US for the first time in decades thanks to Oracle Team USA.

My task was to create a modular template system that could be quickly branded and deployed for all the teams joining the America’s Cup competition. The sites were used for fans to keep track of each team's position in the competition, to share news, video clips, and interviews from each team.

Using Sparkart Group's in-house headless CMS platform, APIs from YouTube, Wordpress and Twitter, and custom templates, I provided eight racing teams their own sites for the America’s Cup competition. Each team's homepage used a suplemented version of the design system. I focused on bringing their branding and personality into this suplement while taking full advantage of CSS's cascade and design system to style the inner pages of each team site quickly.
