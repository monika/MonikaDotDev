## America's Cup Comes Home to San Francisco

In 2013, the America's Cup was headed back to the US for the first time in decades thanks to Team Oracle. While at Sparkart, we were hired to bring the race into the 21st century, get it online and accessible to millions of fans.

My task was to create a modular template system that could be quickly branded and deployed for any teams joining the America's Cup competition. The sites were used for fans to keep track of each team's position in the competition, to share news, video clips, and interviews from each team.

Using our in-house headless CMS platform, APIs from YouTube, Wordpress, and Twitter, and custom templates, I provided twelve racing teams their own sites for the America's Cup competition.
