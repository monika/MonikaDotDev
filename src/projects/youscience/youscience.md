### The Project

_With college tuition increasing every year, YouScience's online aptitude testing can both help students and parents save thousands of dollars a year, and codify students' strongest skills and abilities._

Before YouScience, aptitude testing was out of many students&rsquo; reach. Aptitude testing requires spending hundreds of dollars, visiting a specific testing facility, spending four or more hours taking assessments for the test, and finally reviewing the assessment results with a career councilor face-to-face.

YouScience's goal is to make this entire process more approachable, less expensive and time-consuming, while providing in-depth results that help students make better choices that lean into their strengths for their career options.

While at Sparkart Group, I updated the look and feel of the Ball Aptitude Battery&reg; (BAB) assessments, modernized the user's interactions with the various assessment types, and developed high fidelity prototypes and example animations for YouScience's in-house developers, all in time for official BAB test standardization.
