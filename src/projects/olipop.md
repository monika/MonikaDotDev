### The Project

_A healthful and delicious pre-biotic sparkling tonic drink that needed a site as fresh and invigorating as its new branding._

In the summer of 2018, the co-founders of OLIPOP, Ben Goodwin and David Lester, needed some help: they had a beautiful, delicious, pre-biotic tonic ready to take to market but nowhere to sell it online and were overwhelmed with the e-commerce options available to them.

Based on their needs, budget, and timeline, I guided the co-founders towards Shopify. I set them up with a new theme that reflected the gorgeous visual design their product designers, Break Maiden, produced for them. We also dedicated time towards informational pages that educated consumers on the unique position of OLIPOP as a sparkling tonic drink.

Filled with luscious photography, joyful illustrations, and engaging typography, the store has helped OLIPOP spread into markets across California.

<small>(A secondary phase of the store included active e-commerce and subscription purchasing launched August 2019 in cooperation with Creatix Marketing).</small>

Researchers have identified a correlation between digestive health and a hunter gatherer style diet. That is a diet high in nutrient diversity (different types of foods) and fruits and vegetables that are a natural source of fiber and prebiotics.</p>
