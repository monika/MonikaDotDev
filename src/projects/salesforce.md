## The Story

Folks are hungry for business insight and Salesforce provides that insight in many forms, one of which is their eBooks. Salesforce needed to bring their latest eBook, beautifully designed by the team at IRON Creative, into the browser.

I pushed the edges of technology and centered the animations on our eBook in a new video format, which is set to gracefully downgrade for older browsers. Fun illustrations and iconography are presented as scalable and small vector files, keeping the loading speed quick, the rendering time fast, and the site responsive for various browser sizes and devices - getting people to the insight they want to see as best as I can.
