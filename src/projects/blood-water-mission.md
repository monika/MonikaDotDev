## Blood:Water Mission

### Using the power of BEM and Sass to maintain a cohesive and intuitive code-base for other developers in the mix

Every site that exists on the web long enough goes through growing pains. In the case of Blood:Water Mission, they needed to update their site's design and structure to make it as focused as their altruistic message.
  
The site had been, and would continue to be, updated and modified by other developers. While at Sparkart Group, Inc., I implemented BEM naming methodology to make the markup as self-explanatory as possible. BEM integrated well into my process of componentizing markup with the added benefit of class names very specifically outling the intent and function for each element.

#### Responsibilities

- Semantic HTML, responsive CSS, presentational JS
