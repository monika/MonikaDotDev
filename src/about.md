![A woman wearing clear glasses frames, black and white checkered shirt, and wavy red hair.](/images/img-monika.jpg) I've been using code to express and create for a long time. I started my first website to share my X-Files fan art while I was in high school, using a <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2014/08/forgotten-pioneer-of-teenage-pop-feminism.html">gURL</a> site.

While in college I studied graphic design and I continue to bring that understanding of type, color, motion, and layout into my front-end development.

Offline&mdash;I'm a sewist, a triathlete, a baker, a beginning mandolin student, and fascinated by the slow food movement, food politics, and homesteading.
