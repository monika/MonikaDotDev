![A fat woman wearing clear-framed glasses, a black and white checkered shirt, and wavy red hair.](/images/img-monika.jpg) I created my first website in 1998 while a junior in high school. It was a fan site on [gURL.com](https://web.archive.org/web/19990125090024/http://gurl.com/)</a> site to share my X-Files fan art.

The blend of visual art, user interaction, and code had me hooked. My guestbook was hoppin', my webring was vast, and my appreciation of front-end development as a means of connecting with people and expressing ideas was born.

Studying graphic design in college gave me an understanding of typography, color, motion, layout, empathy, and intent&mdash;skills that I bring into my code.

Offline&mdash;I'm a sewist, video game player, amateur triathlete, baker, beginning mandolin player, and fascinated by food cultures, food politics, and the slow food movement.
